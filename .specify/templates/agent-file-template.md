## Constitutional Principles

This project is governed by `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. All development MUST adhere to:

1. **Pool-Specific Scope**: WAVAX/USDC pool only on Blackhole DEX
2. **Autonomous Rebalancing**: Continuous monitoring and automatic repositioning
3. **Financial Transparency**: Track all costs (gas, fees) and profits (incentives)
4. **Gas Optimization**: Minimize transaction costs through batching and thresholds
5. **Fail-Safe Operation**: Comprehensive error handling, rollback, and safety mechanisms
