# Specification Quality Checklist: Liquidity Staking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Validation Notes

**Validation Pass 1 (2025-12-09)**:

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1, P2, P2)
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015)
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on measurable outcomes
- Detailed edge cases covering common failure scenarios
- Constitutional compliance explicitly mapped to all 5 principles
- Well-defined entities with clear attributes
- Comprehensive assumptions section
